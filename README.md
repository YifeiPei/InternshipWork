# InternshipWork
The repository for the codes I worked in my previous internship.

The Web App contains the reservation system I made by PHP for the Christmas Function for the City of Onkaparinga.
Because the time constraint was very tight that I was only allowed to write the codes in one day, please forgive
the rough format for the content. From my memory, the first day I tested the IIS server with PHP and MS SQL Server
integration, the second day I wrote the codes with my own testing, and the third day the Council put the page on their
own server. The result seemed quite good depending on the feedback.

The NetBeans proejct contains a Java app made by another Intern, Shazhou Huang, for the customer service department in
the City Council and my uncompleted modification for the Immunisation team. When Shazhou was writing the codes, I was collecting
the requirements from the Immunisation team. When I finally had time to make something, Shazhou had completed the
testing version of this app. Then I borrowed his codes aiming to modify it for the immunisation team, which had quite
different requirements from the customer service team. However, it was at the end of my internship. Finally, I only
finished the calendar part and the personnel registration in the database part. I do not know how this goes for the
City Council. Anyhow, they never contacted me again. For this part, I really cannot remember what was the genuine
latest version. NetBeansProject folders contain my own integration while the roster folders contain the versions made
by Shazhou Huang.

The resources folder contains an asset track example made by Jarred Pudney, the colleague when I was the intern, in VBS
and a project made by my previous classmate in our common coursework. They had nothing with my internship actually.
I guess I collected them during the period and I put them into my backup drive. However, I think they might be useful
later so I am sharing them here.
